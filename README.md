A VHDL implementation of DLX architecture with:
 * 2-way set-associative cache with random replacement policy
 * Pipeline hazard-resolving mechanisms (forwarding, stalling)
 
Design is not formally verified. Its functionality, however, has been validated by two benchmarks: bubble sort and prime number calculation.
